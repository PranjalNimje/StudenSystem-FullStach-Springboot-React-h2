1. Packages and classes/interfaces
2. model class
3. @Id -> tells that the property is primary key
4. @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY) ->tells to auto increase the value automatically? GPT

5. After writing model class, go for repository which is interface 
6.  -> model 
	-> repository (interface) 
	-> service (interface then implement interface in class and autowire repository)
	-> controller (restcontroller, requestmapping, autowire service in repo) 
	
7. JpaRepository<Student, Integer> 
		-> Student ->model class
		-> Integer -> Type of Primary key (Id) -> Primary key is id, so its type
		
8. setting database -> Mysql or h2 -> Do all the setting in application.properties file
		spring.h2.console.enabled=true
		spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
		spring.jpa.show-sql=true
		
9. inteface for Sservice , then implement that service interface -> in Service class (autowire repository)
10. Write controller ( request mapping, autowire service in repo )

11. @RequestBody

12. Open Postman -> try get localhost:8080/student/add
	-> Select body -> raw -> json
	-> use double quotes for putting data
	-> Ex. {
    		"name": "Pranjal Nimje",
    		"address": "Maha"
			}
13. Now you can see data in your database h2 console.

14. Service -> we have multiple inbuilt methods for repository which we can use in service
	ex. studentRepository.save(student)
		studentRepository.findAll();
		
15. You have to send request body while doing update functionality.
16. For update -> "localhost:8080/student/update/1"
	Put this in request Body-> Body -> raw -> json
	{
    "name":"Dean",
    "address":"California"
	`}
